# An example of ML Application with the pretrained model and test.

An example of English text tone detection with [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) library.

ML Application with Pretrained Model and Test
This repository contains an example of a Machine Learning (ML) application that demonstrates English text tone detection using the Hugging Face library. The application utilizes a pretrained model to analyze the tone of English text input.

Features
English text tone detection using a pretrained model
Integration with the Hugging Face library for natural language processing
Includes tests for ensuring the functionality of the application

Usage
To use the application, follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application with your English text input to detect the tone

Testing
Tests for the application are set up using GitHub Actions to ensure the reliability of the codebase. The tests cover various aspects of the application, including input validation, model inference, and output verification.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs!
For any questions or issues, please contact Ivan Kazarin.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
